This is a personal toolkit of Bash scripts I use across different servers and projects.

* You are welcome to fork the repo and adapt the scripts for your own use.
* Pull requests are welcome for general improvements (code cleanup, documentation, new features).
* Always test scripts in a safe environment before using in production.
